# Cash and Carry Management System
 This is my first semester project in which I have  created a Cash & Carry Mangement System in c++.<br>
 This management system provides us with a security feature of signing in. <br>
 After signing in with the right credentials, it gives 3 options to choose from: <br>
 1. Bill Calculation. <br>
 2. Add/Remove Product in inventory. <br>
3. Update Quantity of a product. <br><br>

All products information and credentials are stored in a file!
